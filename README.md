# Strummi

## About

The _Strummi_ is a guitar-based Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI) designed to make guitar playing more physically accessible while preserving the tactile and acoustic response of real guitar strings.
It was developed as part of my PhD research at Queen Mary University of London, with my co-researcher Robert Jack.


The Strummi runs on c++ on the [Bela](https://bela.io/) environment.

You can see videos of the Strummi and find out more about it's use on the [projects](https://jacobtfh.github.io/projects) page of [my website](https://jacobtfh.github.io)
