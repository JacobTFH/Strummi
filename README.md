# Strummi

## About

The _Strummi_ is a guitar-based Accessible Digital Musical Instrument (ADMI) designed to make guitar playing more physically accessible while preserving the tactile and acoustic response of real guitar strings.
It was developed as part of my PhD research at Queen Mary University of London, with my colleague Robert Jack.


## To do

- Add source code and design files to git repo
- Design GUI in p5.js for changing tunings and chord voicings
- Make Instructables for DMLab AMIC
- Test with cycfi nu pickups
- Improvements to sound: body resonance / pickup modelling etc.
